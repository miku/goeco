## Sustainability and security

> Sustainability is ability to maintain or support a process **over time** (also maintain ecological balance)

* or: software maintenance

> Security: practice of protecting software or information against attacks.

* we'll choose a few elements of security, as they relate to software maintenance

Go has a focus on programming practice and that goes well beyond the language.
