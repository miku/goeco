% These lines should usually go into a .sty file,
% but I'll leave them here so that it's easier to
% see how to customise a Beamer theme.
% Remember, the Beamer manual is your friend!!

%% So if your re-definitions have a @ somewhere, you
%% _MUST_ put a \makeatletter before these lines and then
%% \makeatother after them. This trick can only be done
%% in the preamble! BUT if you're doing these re-definitions
%% in a .sty file (so that you \usepackage it later), you
%% don't need the \makeatletter and \makeatother.
\makeatletter

%% Set the left and right margins
\setbeamersize{text margin left=1em,text margin right=1em}

%% FONTS
\setbeamerfont{title}{series=\bfseries,size=\LARGE}
\setbeamerfont{subtitle}{series=\bfseries,size=\Large}
\setbeamerfont{frametitle}{series=\bfseries,size=\small}
\setbeamerfont{block title}{series=\bfseries,size=\normalsize}
\setbeamerfont{footline}{size=\normalsize}

%% COLOURS
%% If you'd like everything to have the same colour
\usebeamercolor{structure}
\setbeamercolor{normal text}{fg=structure.fg}

%% Add a line after the frametitle
\addtobeamertemplate{frametitle}{}{\vspace*{-1ex}\rule{\textwidth}{1pt}}

%% Use circular discs as itemized list markers;
%% there's an existing option in Beamer for it so I'll use it
\setbeamertemplate{itemize items}[circle]

%% Remove default navigation symbols (We'll add the ones we need in the footline
\setbeamertemplate{navigation symbols}{}


%% And before the footline... actually we'd like to re-define
%% the footline
\setbeamertemplate{footline}{%
   %% Beamer headlines and footlines are always full-paperwidth, so if you want the horizontal line to
   %% not span it entirely you'll need to do a bit of arithmetic
   \centering
   \begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\paperwidth-\beamer@leftmargin-\beamer@rightmargin\relax}
   \centering
   \rule{\linewidth}{1pt}\vskip2pt
   \usebeamerfont{footline}%
   \usebeamercolor{footline}%
   %% The frame number smack in the middle
   \hfill\insertpagenumber/\inserttotalframenumber
   \hfill%
   %% ONLY the navigation symbols we want at the far right.
   %% We use an \llap so that it takes up zero width, and doesn't throw the page number off-centre!
   \llap{\insertframenavigationsymbol\insertbackfindforwardnavigationsymbol}\par
   \end{minipage}\vskip2pt
}
